??? note "API"
    An **API** (`Application Programming Interface`) is a technology enabling communication between software applications over the internet. It defines a set of rules and protocols that govern how different software components can interact and exchange data.


!!! info "CRUD APi"
    A CRUD API facilitates the management of data within backend systems through four fundamental operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations are typically mapped to specific HTTP methods:<br>
    **GET**: Used to retrieve data from the server.<br>
    **POST**: Used to create new data on the server.<br>
    **PUT**: Used to update existing data on the server.<br>
    **DELETE**: Used to remove data from the server.<br>
    These methods form the cornerstone of many web applications, enabling comprehensive data manipulation through programmatic interfaces.

## Implementation:
* **`js/`**: Contains the implementation of the CRUD application using [Mern](./JS/)
* **`python/`**: Contains the implementation of the CRUD application using Python Fastapi and flask.
