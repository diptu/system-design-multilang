# Getting Started 

Welcome to the `system-design-multilang` repository! This project aims to provide practical examples and exercises for learning and practicing system design concepts using various programming languages.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to help you easily find examples related to specific system design topics and programming languages. You'll generally find the following structure:

## layout

    README.md       # Repository-level overview
    concept-name-01  
    language-01/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
    language-02/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.

* **Concept Folders:** Each top-level folder represents a key system design concept (e.g., `microservices`, `caching`, `databases`, `message-queues`).
* **Language Folders:** Within each concept folder, you'll find subfolders named after the programming languages used to demonstrate that concept (e.g., `python`, `node`).
* **Concept README:** Each concept folder may contain a `README.md` file providing a brief explanation of the concept and its relevance.
* **Code Files:** The language-specific folders will contain the actual code examples and potentially instructions on how to run them.

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Explore Concepts:** Navigate through the top-level folders to find the system design concept you're interested in learning about.
2.  **Choose a Language:** Within a concept folder, select the programming language you're comfortable with or want to explore.
3.  **Review the Code:** Examine the code examples to understand how the system design concept is implemented in that specific language.
4.  **Run the Code (If Applicable):** Follow any instructions provided within the language-specific folder or the concept's `README.md` to run the code and experiment.
5.  **Compare Implementations:** Explore the same concept implemented in different programming languages to see the variations and trade-offs.
